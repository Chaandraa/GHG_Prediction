# 🌱 GHG Emissions Visualization Project

This project is part of the **AICTE Skill4Future Internship**. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using real-world supply chain data for U.S. industries and commodities.

<small>Using the supply-chain greenhouse gas emission dataset (sector-level GHG emissions in CO₂-equivalent), build a predictive model for future emissions by sector or organization. For example, forecast next-year emissions for each industry sector based on historical trends and economic factors.</small>

## 📁 Files Included

- `GHG_.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations.
- `SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx`: Dataset provided by the internship(may not be publicaly available)

**Dataset Details:**
-**Dataset Source:** Provided by AICTE Skill4Future Internship ((may not be publicaly available).
- **Features:** Unit, Substance, Industry name, Commodity, Emission Factor, Energy Consumption.
- **Target Variable:** Emission Factor (CO₂ equivalent)
- **Type:** Mixed numeric and categorical
